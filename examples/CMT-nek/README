This example shows a shock tube in CMT-nek (branch 'jason' of
https://github.com/dpzwick/Nek5000) coupled with the particle
solver ppiclF (https://github.com/dpzwick/ppiclF).

- 2D and 3D examples provided.
- The gas is air (ideal gas).
- The pressure ratio is 10 (set in usrdat2 and used in usric
  as the initial conditions.
- The diaphram is located at 0.32 in y.
- The particles are of 1200E-6 um and 1000 kg/m^3 density.
- They are initially placed with no overlap from 0.35 to 0.45 in y
  at 20% mean volume fraction (initialized in usrdat2).
- Particles feedback forces through the routine userf, where the
  forces include the throttling term p*grad(phig) and the 
  hydrodynamic user-set coupled forces from ppiclF.
- Particles are integrated every RK stage in the routine cmtchk
